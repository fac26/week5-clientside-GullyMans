# Gully Man Game

A Spell game built with React, featuring Banana Joe and VsCode.

## Rules of the Game

1. The game consists of a game board with several "holes" where "gully mans" (little characters) occasionally appear.
2. The player's goal is to click on each gully man as they appear to score points.
3. The player's score is displayed at the end of the game, which lasts for a predetermined duration of time.
4. The player loses a life if they fail to click on a gully man. The game ends after all lives are lost.
5. The game includes various power-ups, including the "Freeze" power-up, which momentarily freezes the gully men, making them easier to click on.
6. As the game progresses, the gully men appear more quickly, making the game harder to play.

The objective of the game is to click as many gully men as possible while avoiding losing all lives and using power-ups to achieve a high score.
